# NTab

**NTab** is intended to be the standard for a browser's "New Page" tab. Inspired by the shortfallings of alternative "new tab" extensions such as [Infinity New Tab](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/infinity-new-tab-pro/nnnkddnnlpamobajfibfdgfnbcnkgngh?hl=en) on browsers such as Google Chrome, this project is intended to provide users with an engaging and productivity-stimulating page to begin their exploration of the world wide web.

***Note:** NTab is not the final name for this product, because under my personal opinion it is not cool enough. However, it will work for now. Additionally, this project's **license information** can be found in LICENSE.md.*

## Development Timeline

**Phase 1** of this project is on track for completion by **end of 2018**. Phase 1 will be coded as a standard website (HTML/CSS/JS) with a main HTML document representing a new tab. This is simply to develop an understanding of NTab's UI and features.

**Phase 2** of this project involves rebuilding and compiling aspects of the code to be a suitable Google Chrome extension.

**Phase 3** of this project is similar to Phase 2, except modifying the project to be a suitable Safari extension.

**Phase 4** of this project is having user data saved in their local cookies and having NTab's page be an actual website hosted on Github Pages. Making it the new tab page is as easy as pasting NTab's public URL into your browser settings, instead of having to download any extensions.
